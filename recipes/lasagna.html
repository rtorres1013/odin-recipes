        While not a 30-minute meal, this lasagna is quicker and more straightforward than most. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're in a real time crunch, use your favorite jarred red sauce. For greater success with the lasagna noodles, which have a tendency to stick together, boil them in the largest pot possible or work in batches.

        They need as much water as possible to move freely so they dont clump. This lasagna can be assembled, baked and refrigerated up to five days ahead, or frozen up to a month ahead if wrapped tightly.
